In both anisotropic and tuned anisotropic networks, reciprocally
connected pairs occur more often than in a random network with the
same connection density (Fig.~\ref{fig:2neuron1}A).

However, is this due to anisotropy? Indeed, we find almost identical
pair counts in rewired and distance-dependent networks
(Fig.~\ref{fig:2neuron1}B). The overrepresentation of reciprocal
connections in the data of Perin et al.~\cite{Perin2011} is not
explained by distance-dependency (Fig.~\ref{fig:2neuron2}), so that
there could be other pair-symmetric irregularities in the connection
probabilities that cause the overrepresentation \cite{Hoffmann2017}.

Next we tested the occurrence of three neuron patterns as reported in
\cite{Song2005}. We found that in alignment with experimental results,
certain motifs are strongly overrepresented in the anisotropic
networks (Fig.~\ref{fig:3neuron}). Here, it is indeed anisotropy that
causes the motifs to appear more often -- the motif
overrepresentations are drastically reduced in rewired and
distance-dependent
networks.  %% In particular, motifs 4, 10, 12 and 14 were also reported in \cite{Perin2011} to be overrepresented.

Perin et al.~\cite{Perin2011} reported that in somatosenory cortex of
rats, groups of neurons more often show a high connection density than
expected from the measured distance-dependent connection
probabilities. Both anisotropic and tuned anisotropic networks also
showed this effect in groups of 3, 6, 8 and 12 cells
(Fig.~\ref{fig:clusters}).

What other network connectivity properties does anisotropy affect? By
only partially rewiring anisotropic networks, we found that the
distribution of shared inputs to a random pair of neurons is shaped by
anisotropy (Fig.~\ref{fig:rewcom}A-C). In anisotropic networks
unconnected, unidirectionally connected and reciprocally connected
neuron pairs have distinctly different in-neighbour distributions,
which is not the case for distance-dependent networks
(Fig.~\ref{fig:rewcom}D-E).
